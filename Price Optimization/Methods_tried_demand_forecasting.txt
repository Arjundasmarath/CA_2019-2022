Methods Tried:-

	1. Linear Regression
		1) Zero Sales
		2) Non Zero Sales
		3) Single Price Zone and Multiple Price zone
		4) Item ID level and Productline level
		5) One hot encoding for tentpoles and previous week sales
		6) Interaction between holidays and previous week sales
		7) Scatter Plot metrics table (R-Square, RMSE, MAE, MAPE)
	
	2. Multiple Regreesion Models 
		1) Random Forest
		2) XG Boost
		3) Different Price Zones
		4) Product Line level
		5) Price Zone and Product line level
		6) One Hot encoded Months
		7) Z-Score (Quantity and Price)
		8) Scatter Plot metrics table (R-Square, RMSE, MAE, MAPE)
		
	3) ARIMA 
		1) Item ID level
		2) Trend and Periodicity
		3) Forecast for next 5 periods and comparrisson chart
	
	4) XG Boost Regression
		1) Model based on multiple levels of ratio of Zero Sales vs Non Zero Sales (25%, 35% and 50%)
		2) CV calculation for variability check in both training and test data.
	
	5) Croston and Holt Winters
	
	6) Clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN)
		1) Cluster as one of the predictors
		2) Model looped through clusters and product line
		
	7) Price and Cogs Imputations for Zero Sales records
		
	8) Multi-Phase Model
		1) Built multiple classification models (Logistic regression, Ada Boost, Naive Bayes, XG boost)
		2) Regreesion model for Non Zero Sales alone
		3) Combined both model for final Prediction
		4) Tried probabilistic Approac also (QZ Idea)
		5) Ratio based(50%) and All the SKUs 
		
	9) Discriptive Table for all SKUs
	
	10) Similar SKU identification
